# AI-Debate Crew

Welcome to the AI-Debate Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com).   
Pit the agents on a hot topic and watch them engage in real debates and argue their positions.   
The judge makes the final decision on whose arguments are more convincing.   

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```
### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```

This command initializes the ai_debate Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

## Understanding Your Crew

The ai_debate Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools.   
These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives.   
The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
